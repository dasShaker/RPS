# RPS
Rock, Paper, Scissors

I decided I needed to practice Python concepts I was learning with some practical examples. I've been having some difficulty working with dictionaries and wanted to incorporate those into this simple game.  I also don't enjoy writing long logic trees so I tried to shrink those up as much as possible. 

I've tried to integrate some console controls, but eventually the idea is to take this game and turn it into something with graphics and sound, possibly with PyGame or the Arcade Library.  This is all really just practice for me.

I'm going to have to go through again and comment the code...
